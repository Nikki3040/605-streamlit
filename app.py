st.subheader("Introduction")
st.markdown("As cities continue to grow and shift towards sustainable transportation, bike-sharing systems have emerged as a crucial component of urban mobility. They provide a flexible, eco-friendly, and cost-effective means of transportation for daily commuters, recreational riders, and tourists alike. However, understanding when and how these bike-sharing systems are utilized is essential for optimizing station locations, adjusting bike availability, and improving overall service efficiency. In this data story, we analyze the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset, which contains detailed records of bike rental activity in Washington, D.C., collected over two years (2011-2012). This dataset provides valuable insights into hourly and daily rental patterns, influenced by factors such as time of day, day of the week, seasonality, and weather conditions. By leveraging visual analytics, we explore how different user behaviors emerge based on commuting patterns, weekday vs. weekend usage, and impact of weather conditions, time of day, seasonal variations, and user behavior.")

st.subheader("Objective")
st.markdown("Through our analysis, we aim to answer key questions about bike-sharing trends: How do rental patterns fluctuate across different timescales? Are there noticeable variations between weekdays and weekends? How do external factors like weather, temperature, and wind speed shape bike-sharing demand? How do rental behaviors differ between registered users and casual riders? By addressing these questions, we seek to uncover actionable insights that can help urban planners, policymakers, and bike-sharing companies optimize service availability, improve user experience, and better accommodate evolving urban mobility needs.")

st.subheader("Dataset")
st.markdown("The dataset provides detailed records of bike-sharing rentals in Washington, D.C., including temporal attributes such as date, year, month, hour, day of the week, and holiday/workday status, as well as weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather. It also includes user information, distinguishing between casual and registered users, along with total bike rentals. Two primary files were analyzed: hour.csv, which contains hourly bike rental data with 17,379 records, and day.csv, which includes daily bike rental data with 731 records. With this rich dataset, let's dive into the patterns that shape bike-sharing trends.")

st.subheader("Methodology")
st.markdown("**Visualizations**")
st.markdown("Several interactive visualizations were created using Plotly and Streamlit to better understand bike rental trends. Clustering analysis (KMeans) was performed to segment rental demand into Low, Medium, and High categories, with normalization applied to numerical features before clustering. A scatter plot visualized bike rental demand by temperature, categorizing demand levels using KMeans. The impact of temperature, humidity, and wind speed on rentals under different weather conditions was analyzed using facet-based scatter plots, ensuring proper layout adjustments for clarity. Additionally, stacked bar charts were employed to examine seasonal preferences among casual vs. registered riders. All plots were integrated into a Streamlit dashboard, allowing interactive exploration of rental patterns. The methodology ensured that both regression analysis and clustering provided actionable insights into bike demand dynamics.")
st.markdown("**Predictive Modeling of Bike Rentals**")
st.markdown("The predictive modeling process was designed to forecast bike rental demand based on various environmental and temporal features. The dataset was first preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring numerical consistency. A train-test split (80-20) was performed to allow robust model evaluation. Multiple regression models were implemented, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Bayesian Ridge, Huber, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbors. Each model was evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² scores to assess performance. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was conducted for selected models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees to optimize predictive accuracy. The best model’s feature importance was analyzed using the Gradient Boosting Regressor, revealing which factors most influenced bike rental trends. Finally, the results were visualized in Streamlit, allowing users to compare model performance and explore feature significance interactively.")
st.markdown("**Predictive Modeling for Clustering-Based Demand Classification**")
st.markdown("A separate approach was taken to cluster rental demand patterns based on environmental conditions, particularly temperature and humidity. The dataset underwent feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize values before applying KMeans clustering with three clusters: Low Demand, Medium Demand, and High Demand. The clustering results were assigned human-readable labels, providing an intuitive understanding of demand segmentation. To further explore the demand structure, a scatter plot was generated to visualize bike rental demand based on temperature, with colors representing different demand clusters. Additionally, a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model was prepared for future classification tasks to determine how well the temperature-humidity combination predicts rental demand levels. The visualization was implemented using Plotly and Streamlit, offering an interactive way to explore how weather conditions influence rental demand patterns.")

Contrastingly, Winter has the lowest median rentals, around 2000, with some days experiencing near-zero usage, which may be due to typical harsh weather conditions that occur during the Winter months. Fall exhibits moderate bike usage, but with a few extreme outliers. The variability in Summer and Spring highlights fluctuating demand, while Winter and Fall rentals are more consistent but lower overall.

On weekdays (Monday to Friday), there are two distinct peaks in bike rentals: one in the morning between 7-9 AM and another in the evening between 4-7 PM. These trends indicate that a significant portion of users rely on bike-sharing services for commuting to work or school. In contrast, weekends (Saturday and Sunday) exhibit a more gradual increase in demand throughout the day, with peak usage occurring later in the morning and early afternoon, around 10 AM - 6 PM. This suggests a shift from structured commuting-based rentals to recreational or leisurely bike rides. Late-night and early-morning bike rentals remain consistently low across all days, with minimal activity between 12 AM and 5 AM, indicating limited demand during these hours. However, weekend nights show slightly higher late-night rentals, likely due to social outings or nightlife activities. Additionally, Fridays stand out as a transitional day, displaying characteristics of both weekday commuting behavior and increasing evening leisure activity. Unlike other weekdays, Friday’s evening peak extends later into the night, reflecting a gradual shift into weekend patterns. Overall, this visualization highlights the clear distinction between weekday and weekend bike rental behaviors. Weekdays are characterized by structured demand tied to work and school schedules, while weekends cater more to flexible, leisure-oriented biking. These insights can be valuable for bike-sharing companies and urban planners, helping them optimize bike availability, adjust station placements, and enhance overall user experience based on demand fluctuations.")

The slight decline on weekends could indicate that fewer people are commuting, although there is still significant bike usage. The box plot complements this by showing the distribution and variability of bike rentals for each day. It reveals that while weekdays generally have higher median rentals, the spread is also greater, suggesting higher fluctuations in demand. This could be due to variations in weather, events, or different commuting patterns. Interestingly, weekend rentals have a wider range, indicating some days see substantial usage spikes, possibly due to recreational activities. Together, these two visuals suggest that bike rentals are primarily driven by weekday commuting patterns, but weekends still see significant usage, albeit with more variability.

Conversely, colder months (November to February) show lower overall rentals, likely due to unfavorable weather conditions. A consistent two-peak pattern emerges across most months, with demand surging around 8 AM and 5-6 PM, aligning with typical commuting hours. However, during summer months (June–August), the afternoon peak is notably higher, indicating that more people are renting bikes for activities beyond commuting. Additionally, July and August experience the highest rental volumes, while December and January see the lowest, further emphasizing the correlation between temperature, daylight hours, and biking behavior. Another key insight is that during warmer months, usage remains sustained throughout the day, while in colder months, demand is concentrated primarily around peak commute times. These findings suggest that bike rental usage is strongly season-dependent, with warmer months encouraging more widespread and extended use beyond essential travel needs.")

st.markdown("Analysis: Based on the results of the comparative table, it can be observed that that Gradient Boosting Regression is the most effective model for predicting bike rental demand, with an R² score of 0.8469. Hour of the day emerged as the most critical factor, reflecting peak rental times during commuting hours. Temperature and weekday trends also significantly influenced demand, with higher rentals on warm days and workdays showing distinct peaks. Adverse weather conditions such as rain and snow were found to reduce rentals considerably. The presence of holidays showed varied effects on demand, with some seasonal variations. These insights suggest that bike-sharing systems can optimize availability by reallocating bikes dynamically during peak hours, adjusting pricing strategies based on weather conditions, and implementing targeted promotions to increase ridership during weekends and holidays. Ultimately, machine learning models offer a robust approach to forecasting demand, aiding both urban mobility planners and bike-sharing companies in improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.")
